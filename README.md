# Android Unmock Gradle Plugin

## Purpose

This is a super simple plugin to be used in combination with the new unit testing feature of the Gradle Plugin / Android Studio. ( http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support )

It tries to solve the problem that you have to mock each and every Android SDK class (even SparseArray, TextUtils etc.) by allowing you to use selected classes from a real Android-Jarfile.

## How to use

Available on jcenter: [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/bjoernq/maven/de.mobilej.unmock/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/bjoernq/maven/de.mobilej.unmock/_latestVersion)

Add the plugin to your buildscript dependencies and make sure to use the jcenter repository:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        classpath 'de.mobilej.unmock:UnMockPlugin:0.3.3'
    }
}
```

And this to the module's build script:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'de.mobilej.unmock'
```

Additionally you have to configure which classes to use and where to get the real Android.jar from. e.g:

```groovy
unMock {
    // URI to download the android-all.jar from. e.g. https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/robolectric/android-all/
    downloadFrom 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/robolectric/android-all/4.3_r2-robolectric-0/android-all-4.3_r2-robolectric-0.jar'

    keepStartingWith "android.text.TextUtils"
    keepStartingWith "android.util."
    keepStartingWith "android.text."
    keepStartingWith "android.content.ContentValues"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.Intent"
    keep "android.location.Location"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.res.Configuration"
    keepStartingWith "org."
    keepStartingWith "libcore."
    keepStartingWith "com.android.internal.R"
    keepStartingWith "com.android.internal.util."
    keep "android.net.Uri"

    keepAndRename "java.nio.charset.Charsets" to "xjava.nio.charset.Charsets"
}
```

keep keeps the specified class (and it's possible present inner classes)
keepStartingWith keeps every class which FQN starts with the given string
keepAndRename let you keep a class while renaming it (e.g. needed for classes in the "java" top-level package since these are only allowed to be loaded from the boot classpath)

That's it. I use the android-all.jar from the Robolectric project for convenience.

Have a look at the example contained in this repository for more details.
