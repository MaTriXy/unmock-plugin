# Android Unmock Gradle Plugin

## Purpose

This is a super simple plugin to be used in combination with the new unit testing feature of the Gradle Plugin / Android Studio. ( http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support )

It tries to solve the problem that you have to mock each and every Android SDK class (even SparseArray, TextUtils etc.) by allowing you to use selected classes from a real Android-Jarfile.

## How to use

Available on jcenter: [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/bjoernq/maven/de.mobilej.unmock/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/bjoernq/maven/de.mobilej.unmock/_latestVersion)

Add the plugin to your buildscript dependencies and make sure to use the jcenter repository:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        classpath 'de.mobilej.unmock:UnMockPlugin:0.6.5'
    }
}
```

And this to the module's build script:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'de.mobilej.unmock'
```

Additionally you have to configure which classes to use and where to get the real Android.jar from. e.g:

```groovy
unMock {
    keep "android.widget.BaseAdapter"
    keep "android.widget.ArrayAdapter"
    keep "android.os.Bundle"
    keepStartingWith "android.database.MatrixCursor"
    keep "android.database.AbstractCursor"
    keep "android.database.CrossProcessCursor"
    keepStartingWith "android.text.TextUtils"
    keepStartingWith "android.util."
    keepStartingWith "android.text."
    keepStartingWith "android.content.ContentValues"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.ComponentName"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.ContentUris"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.ContentProviderOperation"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.ContentProviderResult"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.UriMatcher"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.Intent"
    keep "android.location.Location"
    keepStartingWith "android.content.res.Configuration"
    keepStartingWith "org."
    keepStartingWith "libcore."
    keepStartingWith "com.android.internal.R"
    keepStartingWith "com.android.internal.util."
    keep "android.net.Uri"

    keepAndRename "java.nio.charset.Charsets" to "xjava.nio.charset.Charsets"
}

dependencies {
    // dependency to android-all to use
    unmock 'org.robolectric:android-all:4.3_r2-robolectric-0'
}

```

|Statement|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|downloadFrom|here you configure the url to download the android-all.jar from, optionally you can specify a directory to download the file to (e.g. to \<mydirectory\>) - the default is the tmpdir, _DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0: create a unmock dependency_|
|keep|keeps the specified class (and it's possibly present inner classes)|
|keepStartingWith|keeps every class which FQN starts with the given string|
|keepAndRename|let you keep a class while renaming it (e.g. needed for classes in the "java" top-level package since these are only allowed to be loaded from the boot classpath)|
|delegateClass|every method (and constructor) in the given class is delegated to de.mobilej.ABridge. Makes it easier to mock things in a framework class you inherit from|

That's it!

Have a look at the example contained in this repository for more details.

Starting from version 0.3.5 you can leave out the configuration closure which will result using defaults (which are shown in the example above).

downloadFrom is now optional. If not given it will use 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/robolectric/android-all/4.3_r2-robolectric-0/android-all-4.3_r2-robolectric-0.jar'

If you use any of the keep statements the default configuration will be cleared. (So your own configuration is not adding but replaces the default).

> By default the _android-all_ file is downloaded to the system's temporary folder. Some systems purge the temp folder on reboot. In most cases this should be no issue but on unreliable or slow internet conections this might be inconvenient. In that case you could download the _android-all_ file yourself and specify a _file:///\<path\>/\<file\>_ url or you can specify a directory to place the downloaded file by specifying _to_ after the url in _downloadFrom_, e.g. ```downloadFrom 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/robolectric/android-all/4.3_r2-robolectric-0/android-all-4.3_r2-robolectric-0.jar' to '/yourdirectory_to_download_to'```

> As of 0.6.0 you should prefer to use a dependency for the android-all.jar

|0.1.2|fixed a bug preventing the plugin to work correctly on Windows systems|
|0.1.3|the binary is targeting Java 1.7, again|
|0.2.0|support class renaming, rebuild jar if build file changed|
|0.3.0|use Gradle way of upToDate check, have a DSL for the configuration|
