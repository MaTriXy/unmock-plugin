# Android Unmock Gradle Plugin

## Purpose

This is a super simple plugin to be used in combination with the new unit testing feature of the Gradle Plugin / Android Studio. ( http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support )

It tries to solve the problem that you have to mock each and every Android SDK class (even SparseArray, TextUtils etc.) by allowing you to use selected classes from a real Android-Jarfile.

## How to use

Add this to your buildscript dependencies:

```groovy
classpath 'de.mobilej.unmock:UnMockPlugin:0.1.0'
```

And this to the module's build script:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'de.mobilej.unmock'
```

Additionally you have to configure which classes to use and where to get the real Android.jar from. e.g:

```groovy
unMock {
    // URI to download the android-all.jar from. e.g. https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/robolectric/android-all/
    allAndroid =
            'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/robolectric/android-all/4.3_r2-robolectric-0/android-all-4.3_r2-robolectric-0.jar'

    // classes to keep
    // matched by "startsWith" - you also need to include the dependencies manually
    keep = [
            "android.text.TextUtils",
            "android.util.",
            "android.text.",
            "android.content.ContentValues",
            "android.content.Intent",
            "android.location.Location",
            "android.content.res.Configuration",
            "org.",
            "libcore.",
            "com.android.internal.R",
            "com.android.internal.util."
    ]
}
```

That's it. I use the android-all.jar from the Robolectric project for convenience.

Have a look at the example contained in this repository.
